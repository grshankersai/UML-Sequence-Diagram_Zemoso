This is a sequence diagram created for access control entry system
Where there is a 3-layer security system.\n
In the 1st layer the visitor undergoes basic checks which is done at the security gate (like if the vehicle in which he travelled is save to enter.)
Coming to the second layer the user is checked if he possesses any harmful material or any material which violated the list of permitted items inside the office premise.
The 3rd layer checks for the visitorâ€™s id card (Temporary_id issued at layer 2 if the person is not an employee) and the finger print or iris scan and matches it with the security data base.
If all these layers permit the user to enter after the security checks, they perform at each layer then the user is allowed to enter the office premise.
